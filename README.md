# Financial-Performance-Audit-Automation

Objective: Automate 75% of manual audit tasks, reducing audit errors by 20% and saving 200+ hours annually.

KPIs:

Audit Accuracy: Increase accuracy by 20% through automated anomaly detection.
Audit Efficiency: Reduce manual intervention by 75%.
Cost Savings: Quantify cost savings based on time saved through automation.
Tools & Techniques:

Python:
NumPy & Pandas: For processing large-scale financial data and preparing datasets for anomaly detection.
SciPy: Apply statistical models for anomaly detection (e.g., z-score for outlier detection).
Alteryx:
Create data workflows to automate ETL processes, updating audit reports in real-time.
SQL:
Extract transactional data from enterprise databases (e.g., SAP) for auditing purposes.
Power BI:
Develop a real-time monitoring dashboard to visualize audit results, anomalies, and compliance metrics.
Implementation:

Data Pipeline Setup: Use SQL to extract financial data and feed it into Alteryx, where automated ETL processes will prepare the data for analysis.
Anomaly Detection: Implement anomaly detection algorithms in Python (e.g., z-score, isolation forests) to identify unusual patterns in financial transactions.
Dashboard & Alerts: Create a Power BI dashboard that shows audit outcomes, highlighting transactions flagged as high-risk for immediate attention.
Automation & Monitoring: Alteryx will run the ETL process weekly, ensuring the data is up-to-date for every audit cycle.
Expected Outcome: Automating 75% of audit tasks, reducing errors by 20%, and saving 200+ hours annually.
